Opensource Private Search is an open source search engine.

Only frontend at the moment.  
  
This is the normal version you will use if you host the backend in your network for your own personal usage:
[https version](https://stringmanolo.github.io/0P5/)  
    
If you want to host the server locally and allow anyone else to access it without set a full enviroment (buy domain, generate certficates, set https...), you can use this [http version](http://0p5.glitch.me/) that will allow you to run the backend in local and share it using ngrok.
